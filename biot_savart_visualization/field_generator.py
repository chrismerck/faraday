""" Functions defined in this file allow for the generation of vector
fields through common mathematical functions.

Todo:
	- Implement a function that generates a vector field in the shape of
	  a circle.
	- Implement a function that generates a vector field through a
	  polynomial function.
	- Implement a function that generates a vector field with a path of a
	  curve. This can be done with BÃ©zier Curves or some other form of a
	  parametric equation.
