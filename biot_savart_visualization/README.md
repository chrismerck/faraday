This is a demo visualization of a potential current running through a wire and the magnetic field which it generates.

Tested with Python 3.4.3 and matplotlib version 2.0.0b3+1972.g2cdb5aa

The newest matplotlib version is required because of the normalization feature added to the 3D quiver plot function.

### TODO (In no particular order)
- [ ] Add a way for the user to specifiy settings during initial runtime of the program. Or load the settings from a file.
- [ ] Custom current input.
- [ ] Run spellcheck on all of the documentation.
