This is a demo visualization of a potential current running through a wire and the magnetic field which it generates.

This is a very early version and is meant only for testing cubes. Attempts at generating any other fields will probably break the simulation.

Tested with Python 3.4.3 and matplotlib version 2.0.0b3+1972.g2cdb5aa

The newest matplotlib version is required because of the normalization feature added to the 3D quiver plot function.
